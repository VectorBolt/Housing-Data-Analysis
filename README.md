# Housing-Data-Analysis
An analysis of data from the 2019 American Housing Survey, conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau. This is a longitudinal survey that studies the same set of housing units every other year. We hypothesize that there is a positive correlation between the market value of a family’s house and the family’s annual income. This is a large dataset that with over 60,000 rows (one for each household) and 1,000 columns (fields for each household). This analysis focuses on a few variables of interest: Family Income, Market Value, Monthly Housing Costs, and Unit Size.

See `FINAL Housing Data Analysis.pdf` for the final report, including a description of the data, analysis of graphs, and conclusions.
